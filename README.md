# Web development utilities

A bunch of useful scripts to automate repeatable jobs used in multiple web developmennt projects

## ```favgen.sh``` - Favicon generator

Designed to generate favicons of various sizes from an input image. It creates a `head.html` file with link tags and generates a `manifest.json` file for a web application. The script allows customization of the app name, description, package name, and output folder. The input image must be at least 128x128 pixels in size. If the app description is not provided as an argument, the script will prompt the user to enter it.# webdevtool
